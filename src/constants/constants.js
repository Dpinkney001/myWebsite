I found the data set on the NYC Open Data website at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95 The data set was filtered to only used the data from the Bronx only from 2014 to the present date (2021). Then that dataset was further filtered to include only data from the 10458 zip code.",
